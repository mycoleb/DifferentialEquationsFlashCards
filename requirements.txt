# Requirements for Differential Equations Flashcard Game
# This game uses only Python standard library modules

# No external dependencies required!
# The game uses the following built-in Python modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework - included with Python)
# - random (for shuffling cards)
# - math (imported but not currently used - available for future enhancements)

# If you want to add additional features, you might consider:
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For plotting differential equation solutions
# numpy>=1.21.0      # For numerical methods and calculations
# sympy>=1.9         # For symbolic mathematics and equation solving
# pillow>=8.3.0      # For enhanced image support in tkinter
